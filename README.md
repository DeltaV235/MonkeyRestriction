A system for receiving streaming and storing it as a video.

The system consists of a video capture end and a server end. 
The capture end can use an Android phone or other devices with filming and streaming capabilities. 
The capture end is responsible for streaming, while the server end handles storage and recognition 
of vehicle and road information.
